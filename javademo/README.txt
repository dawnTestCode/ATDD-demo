This is a Java/Fitnesse port of the Login example originally created with Ruby & Robot Framework.

It is not done. It is not close to done. Actually, it doesn't even do anything remotely useful yet at all. But the bare bones are here. I'll be building on it.

Dependencies you'll need:

- Mockito (references in the code now)
- Jetty (eventually)
- SeleniumRC (eventually)
- Fitnesse (to run the Fitnesse tests under specs/FitnesseRoot)
