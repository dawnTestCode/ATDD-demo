<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<form action="/create" method="post" name="authform">
User Name: <input type="text" name="uname" /><br />
Password: <input type="text" name="pwd" /><br />
Note that for the purposes of this example, this UI does not hide the password. That way we can all see the values we're trying. If this were a real application, the password field would be declared as type "password" so that passwords would show as *** when entered.
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
