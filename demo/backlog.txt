Prioritized Backlog
-------------------
As an administrator, I want users creating accounts to be required to choose secure passwords so that their accounts cannot be hacked by someone using a password guessing program. That means users are required to create accounts using only secure passwords (strings of at least 6 characters with at least one letter, one number, and one symbol)
- us only keyboards

----------------------

Don't enable "create" until both name & pwd filled in

Localization/internationalization

Make ppl confirm their passwords

Constrain user names the same way we constrain passwords.

Users can log out.

Status (logged in, etc.) are persisted.

Users can change passwords (when logged in).

Users with insecure passwords (legacy) are forced to change them on next login.

User cannot change password to the previous password.

User accounts are suspended - and thus not valid - after 3 failed login attempts

There is a built in administrator account, with the default password my@dm1n, that has special privileges.

Some users are administrators with special privileges

Administrators can change passwords for any user

Administrators can reset suspended accounts

Administrators can promote other users to be administrators
